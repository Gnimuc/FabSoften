# Models

When configuring CMake, CMake will automatically fetch those pre-trained models into this folder if not exist. 

If you'd like to provide the models yourself, you could manually put those models in this folder. 

The file hierarchy looks like this:

```
.
├── .gitignore
├── shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat
└── README.md
```
